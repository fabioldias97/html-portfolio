<h1>The TV Series According to Fabio</h1>

<h2>My top 3 TV series of all-time</h2>

<hr>

<h3>Peaky Blinders</h3>
<p>This my favourite. It's about a gispsy family that runs gangster business in Birmingham. Cilian Murphy stars this show</p>

<h3>Vikings</h3>
<p>This is the second best, that I like as much as the 1st one! Just fenomenal</p>

<h3>Rick & Murphy</h3>
<p>This was the most out the box cartoon I've seen as an adult (maybe the only?).<br>
    But it really makes me think in a super creative perspective.</p>
